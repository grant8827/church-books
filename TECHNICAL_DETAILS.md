## Common Operations Examples

### 1. Adding a New Member

        if form.is_valid():
            member = form.save(commit=False)

            contribution.recorded_by = request.user
            contribution.church = get_user_church(request.user)
            contribution.save()
```

### 3. Generating Reports
```python
@login_required
def generate_monthly_report(request, year, month):
    start_date = datetime(year, month, 1)
    end_date = start_date + relativedelta(months=1)
    
    transactions = Transaction.objects.filter(
        church=get_user_church(request.user),
        date__range=[start_date, end_date]
    )
