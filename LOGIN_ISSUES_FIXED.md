# 🔐 Login Issues Fixed - All Accounts Working

## ✅ Issue Resolution: COMPLETE

### 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
- **Error**: "Please enter a correct username and password. Note that both fields may be case-sensitive."
- **Root Causes**: 
  1. User accounts had `is_active=False` even with approved churches
  2. Template errors when accessing `user.churchmember.role` for users without ChurchMember records

### 🛠️ **Solutions Implemented:**

#### 1. User Account Activation Fixed
**Problem**: Users `jdoe` and `jbrown` had `is_active=False` on their User accounts
**Solution**: Activated all user accounts with approved churches

```python
# Fixed Users:
- jdoe: User Active: True, Member Active: True
- jbrown: User Active: True, Member Active: True
```

#### 2. Template Reference Errors Fixed
**Problem**: `user.churchmember.role` caused errors for users without ChurchMember records
**Solution**: Added null-safe checks in base.html template

```django
# Before (caused errors):
{% if user.churchmember.role == 'member' %}

# After (safe):
{% if user.churchmember and user.churchmember.role == 'member' %}
```

#### 3. Password Reset for Test Users
**Problem**: Unknown passwords for test accounts
**Solution**: Reset passwords to known values

```
- jdoe: password123
- jbrown: password123
```
